# swift-algo
Some swift algorithms to have fun using Playground on Xcode 11

## Prerequesites
- Xcode 11
- Swift 5 (of course)

## Disclosure
Take in account, this algorithm is not checked in terms of performance.

## Please review and propose another way
Please take a look the algorithm, fork, copy, use as you wish, but help me to figure out another way, or another option, for example you will see here algorithms for narrow cases, you can propose a general big one to solve more cases.

## List of Algorithms
- PlaneSeats.playground: Assign passengers seats in an airplane, allocating seats for as many four-person families as possible, from seats between 1A to 1J, assuming a number of 50 rows, taking account reserved and 2 aisles in between.
